What
====

This project provides a set of components and a framework to build layouts based on ReactJS. You will be able to plug many applications as you want: blog, media or cms management into one coherent layout.

The default layout is quite standard:

 - a top navigation bar with a main title, and any elements you like to add.
 - a right collapsable bar with notifications and any elements you like to add.
 - a center view where your application will be.

The project try to use default libraries available in the community:

 - react-router
 - react-bootstrap
 - react-reflux
 - gulp

The ``react-admin`` includes some tools to consume rest services or to share common object across modules. Of course, similar solutions already exists in the community, choices to not use them are either there are not suitable for the use case or a lack of understanding. Anyway the projet is not stable, so it is time to review and challenge those choices.

The project also include some ReactJS components to work with form and build table. You are not force to use them, just check them and make your choice.
